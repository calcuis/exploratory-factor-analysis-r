# exploratory-factor-analysis-r
an example of R code for conducting an exploratory factor analysis

```
# Load the psych package
library(psych)

# Define the function for performing an exploratory factor analysis
perform_exploratory_factor_analysis <- function(data, num_factors) {
  # Perform the factor analysis
  factor_analysis <- fa(data, num_factors)

  # Return the factor loadings matrix
  return(factor_analysis$loadings)
}
```

In this code, we first load the `psych` package, which contains the necessary functions for performing a factor analysis.

Next, we define the function `perform_exploratory_factor_analysis`, which takes in two arguments: the data to be analyzed, and the number of factors to be extracted.

Inside the function, we use the `fa` function from the `psych` package to perform the factor analysis and extract the desired number of factors. We then return the factor loadings matrix, which contains the weights of each variable on each factor. This matrix can be used to interpret the factors and understand the underlying structure of the data.
